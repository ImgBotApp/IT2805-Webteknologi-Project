    <h1>About Excellence</h1>

    <p>
      Excellence started their career at a Daft Punk concert in 2005. The first members were inspired to perform, without uncovering their identities, to prove to their audience that anybody could be a popstar. They started practicing in one of the membersâ€™ garage in 2006, trying to find their jam, going from rock music to classic music, becoming acquainted with all of them. By the time they started performing in front of an audience, there was no crowd they could not please, with their concerts transitioning between smooth jazz and hard rock as smoothly as waves on the ocean.
