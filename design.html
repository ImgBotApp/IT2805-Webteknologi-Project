  <section>
    <h2>1. Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>
      The name of your client, and his or her position in the organization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
    <p>
      A summary paragraph to remind the reader about the
      purpose, goals, and audience of your website. Make it brief and succinct.    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Navigation Structure</h2>
    <p>
      A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using the
      terminology learned in class and the notes on slides “HTML Cont.” in Storyboard and
      Structures sections (slides:122-129). This is not a sketch of your navbar (or whatever), but
      instead a map or description of which pages connect to which other pages. (It is sometimes
      better to describe a clique in words than to try to draw it.) The goal is to explain why the choice
      of a particular structure makes sense for your website.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      A description of design decisions that are universal to your
      site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), the color scheme (for text,
      background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the page and its appearance,
      banner, footer, the social icons bar, or background images (if any of them is applicable). In
      addition to the textual description of these elements, you should include a mockup image of
      this generic page that has only these common elements and no other content. Finally, you
      should describe how these universal design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and
      its audience.

      </figure>

      <p>
        The pictures page contains pictures related to the band, such as pictures of their studio, their concerts, band practices and behind the scenes. It is a simple page with the title “Pictures”, and pictures stacked underneath each other separated by a short text telling the context of the picture and when the picture was taken. Every picture has the same aspect ratio of 16:9, with a max width of 640px and max height of 400px, which means that the pictures will be uploaded as 640px and 400px to reduce loading time, and adjusted according to the specific screen of the user. The pictures will have a small drop shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page contributes to fulfill the purpose of making visitors interested in the band, and become more familiar and feel closer. If visitors feel a bond with the band, that will possibly make them more interested in Excellences activities and would want to support them or see them live, hence buying tickets for shows.  Also, if the visitors see interesting content, they would be more likely to want to follow them on social media to keep updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page we decided to drop the picture header that is common for the other subpages due to that this is a page specific for pictures. It was deemed that there is no need for it as other pictures populate the page to make it interesting.

      <h3>5.8 Contact Us</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure 5.8: Mockup of the Contact Us page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The contact page contains the contact info of the band, including their e-mail and social media links as well as information about where the band is based and what they are available for. This page will make the band easily available for venues and sponsors that could be interested in knowing more and possibly booking the band, or would want to make a sponsor deal. This is also a page which lets fans and other visitors know where they can find out more about Excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page features the same design as the other subpages, with a picture header above the title, and the style of the text and colors matching the rest of the site. Beneath the title ‘Contact Us’ there is the e-mail address, then other info, and finally an encouragement to visit Excellence social media sites along with two buttons linking to their Facebook page and YouTube channels. The social media buttons are of size 70x70px.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Contact Us page contributes to making the band more international by allowing venues from all over the world to contact the band, and also advertises their social media channels to contribute to the like and subscribers goal.

    <h2>6. Minimum Requirements:</h2>
    <p>
      The website must include four distinct JavaScript applications (for
      example, rollovers effects on images or menus, user-defined functions, form validation,
      animations etc.). The four applications must all be different from each other.
      Clearly indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these minimum requirements.
      Please note that each of these items must be constructed entirely by you and not copied from
      external websites on the Web (though you can modify code from our class materials). Once
      you fulfill the minimum requirements with your own code, you are allowed to get code from the
      web (with source attribution) to incorporate certain advanced components (e.g. image galleries
      with transitions), but they will not count as part of the minimum requirements.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline the tasks
      to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a
      list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a
      complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and
      when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
      the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.    </p>
