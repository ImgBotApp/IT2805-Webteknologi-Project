<h2>About Excellence</h2>
<p>Excellence started their career at a Daft Punk concert in 2005. The first members were inspired to perform, without uncovering their identities, to prove to their audience that anybody could be a popstar. They started practicing in one of the members’ garage in 2006, trying to find their jam, going from rock music to classic music, becoming acquainted with all of them. By the time they started performing in front of an audience, there was no crowd they could not please, with their concerts transitioning between smooth jazz and hard rock as smoothly as waves on the ocean.

<h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
<p>The purpose of the website is to make people excited about the band “Excellence” and so they will buy tickets for their concerts. Thus, one of our goals is to inform the visitors on our website about “Excellence” and make visitors interested. We will do this with pages about the band and their music. We will also add some video clips from concerts so people can get the impression that Excellence are cool, and would like to go to the concerts themselves. We will also make a page with tour dates to make it easy for the visitors to plan for when they will attend their next concert. Maybe one time we will make it possible to buy concert tickets at our website.</p>
<p>Another goal to fulfill the purpose is to make people interact with the band through the website and give them answers to their questions. We will do this through the pages for FAQ and Guestbook, and also by giving them contact information. The goal is that the website should be interesting and useful for people either familiar or unfamiliar with the band. The site should give the visitor a good image of the band by just viewing the front page.</p>

<section>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The main audience of the website are young people around 18-30 years old, both men and women, who are interested in learning about the band and like pop music in particular. The audience will include both people unfamiliar and familiar to the band. Thus the main content should be short enough that people unfamiliar to the band don’t get overwhelmed with too much information, but also should contain possibilities for more information related to the band that those who want to know more can utilize. The audience could include supporters of the band, be it fans of the music or someone who would like to sponsor, as well as agencies and venues who might want to sign them up for a contract or a concert. The site should contain information so that they can come in contact with the band about such. Supporters would want to talk to the band or leave messages for the band.

  </p>

  <p>This page gives the user an impression what the identity of the band is. In particular it will tell the user about the band, and will contain information about the band members and their background, how they met, including when and why the band was established, and what kind of genres they play.

  </p><h3>Guestbook/fanclub</h3>

If possible, the page will contain some sort of guestbook system, which will allow the user to leave a comment for others to read, or the page can display other fans statements. If this is not possible, this page will likely be removed.
  </p>

  </p>

<h2>Specific requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p>The home page, or in other words, the front page, should take a maximum of 1 second to load. This shall be done by moving several of the images over to a specific subpage called “pictures”, and by that moving them away from the front, reducing the load time.</p></li>
  <li><p>The page should have a navigation bar either at the front or on the side of the page. The navigation bar should contain a link to all subpages. This will give the site a more professional look, and make it easier to use. All subpages should be accessible in maximum two clicks, using the navigation bar.</p></li>
  <li><p>The page website should have a dark, clean and modern look, at last not white or very bright. Images from a concert are often dark and the images will look worse if the background colour of the pages are bright compared to them. The colour will also help appeal to the fans, as they consist of young adults.</p></li>
<li><p>The picture page should contain at least 5-10 pictures and the front page should have a photo of the band/group.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>Technical difficulties</h2>
<p>The risks associated with the website will be the expectation of a visually pleasing end-result. Allowing fans with different browsers and devices to access the website in the same usable manner would be a challenge, as it would require extensive testing across different platforms, ranging from phones to laptops. It would possibly require extensive use of CSS to make it responsive while also looking good.</p>
<p>For the guestbook, the challenge may be to implement a working prototype of a submission system. The definition of “prototype” in this context is a guestbook which will at the least work locally on a client’s machine, storing their messages across page reloads.</p>
