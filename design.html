<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>
      The name of your client, and his or her position in the organization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
    <p>
      A summary paragraph to remind the reader about the
      purpose, goals, and audience of your website. Make it brief and succinct.    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
    <p>
      A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using the
      terminology learned in class and the notes on slides “HTML Cont.” in Storyboard and
      Structures sections (slides:122-129). This is not a sketch of your navbar (or whatever), but
      instead a map or description of which pages connect to which other pages. (It is sometimes
      better to describe a clique in words than to try to draw it.) The goal is to explain why the choice
      of a particular structure makes sense for your website.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      A description of design decisions that are universal to your
      site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), the color scheme (for text,
      background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the page and its appearance,
      banner, footer, the social icons bar, or background images (if any of them is applicable). In
      addition to the textual description of these elements, you should include a mockup image of
      this generic page that has only these common elements and no other content. Finally, you
      should describe how these universal design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and
      its audience.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
      This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will need to give
      a text description of the content of the page as well as an image of the mockup of the page.
      The text describes what goal(s) this page fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it
      contribute into fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe the content is that
      you might not have yet received the actual content from the client and in your mockup of the
      page you will be using fake text, fake images, etc. While the content can be fake, you should
      try to use meaningful headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally, you should
      describe the design decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any). Here is an
      example:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Images of e-board members are stored as thumbnails to reduce the loading time of the page.
      They appear in a grid format on the left side of the page. Each thumbnail is of size 150x150.
      When clicked, they will open as larger images (320x480) on the right side of the page,
      surrounded by text describing the member's duties and reasons for joining the org. The chosen
      thumbnail will have a surrounding border in gray color, to provide visual feedback to the user
        for the selected content.</i>
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Minimum Requirements:</h2>
    <p>
      The website must include four distinct JavaScript applications (for
      example, rollovers effects on images or menus, user-defined functions, form validation,
      animations etc.). The four applications must all be different from each other.
      Clearly indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these minimum requirements.
      Please note that each of these items must be constructed entirely by you and not copied from
      external websites on the Web (though you can modify code from our class materials). Once
      you fulfill the minimum requirements with your own code, you are allowed to get code from the
      web (with source attribution) to incorporate certain advanced components (e.g. image galleries
      with transitions), but they will not count as part of the minimum requirements.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline the tasks
      to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a
      list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a
      complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and
      when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
      the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.    </p>
