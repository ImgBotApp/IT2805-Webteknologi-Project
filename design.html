    <h2>1. Administrative Details</h2>
    <p>
      We have an imaginary client which are the band Excellence.    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of the website is to make people excited about the band Excellence and to spread information, and further sell more tickets for the concerts. To fulfill the purpose we have made some concrete goals stating what the site should achieve by the end of 2018.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience for our website are the people that the goals are intended for. This include supporters of the band or supporters to be, as well as agencies, venues and sponsors. The music are intended for young adults around 18-30 years old who like pop music.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Navigation Structure</h2>
    <p>
      One of the specific requirements is that the site should have a navigation bar, which links to each page of the site. This creates a navigation structure where each page links to each other page, which is often called the clique navigation structure. We have chosen this navigation structure, because one of the specific requirements is that all pages can be accessed using a maximum of two clicks, and because this is not a site that should be read linearly or hierarchically. The navigation bar should help the user to be aware of the different pages, and find the desired information quickly. This is possible to achieve because the site does not contain that many pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excellence wants to look professional, and a quick and easy navigation is a very important step in achieving this. In addition to the links in the navbar, there is a sitemap in the footer and the content at the “FAQ” page will link to different pages of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “contact us” page, “home” page and the footer of all pages will also link to facebook and YouTube. This makes social media accessible wherever the user is, and this is very important for a band that wants to be known and recognized. Below is a storyboard of the website's structure.

    <h2>4. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      [Insert here]
    </p>
    <h3>Modularity</h3>
    <p>
      In order to facilitate a universal design across the entire website, a standard structure is imposed on the articles. The content section of the page is a replaceable component which will be swapped out upon navigation. It is defined as a column with margins on the left and right side. This allows all the pages to use the same background, navigation bar and footer. The home page is an exception to this rule, which does not follow the form of a column with margins.
    </p>

      <h3>5.5 Tour Dates</h3>

      <h3>5.6 Pictures</h3>

        <figcaption>Figure 5.6: Mockup of the Pictures page.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The pictures page contains pictures related to the band, such as pictures of their studio, their concerts, band practices and behind the scenes. It is a simple page with the title “Pictures”, and pictures stacked underneath each other separated by a short text telling the context of the picture and when the picture was taken. Every picture has the same aspect ratio of 16:9, with a max width of 640px and max height of 400px, which means that the pictures will be uploaded as 640px and 400px to reduce loading time, and adjusted according to the specific screen of the user. The pictures will have a small drop shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page contributes to fulfill the purpose of making visitors interested in the band, and become more familiar and feel closer. If visitors feel a bond with the band, that will possibly make them more interested in Excellences activities and would want to support them or see them live, hence buying tickets for shows.  Also, if the visitors see interesting content, they would be more likely to want to follow them on social media to keep updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page we decided to drop the picture header that is common for the other subpages due to that this is a page specific for pictures. It was deemed that there is no need for it as other pictures populate the page to make it interesting.
      </p>

      <h3>5.7 Video</h3>

      <p>
        The video page contains videos related to the band, such as video from their concerts, practices and behind the scenes.
      </p>

      <h3>5.8 Contact Us</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="mockups/Contact%20us%20-%20Mockup.jpg"
             alt="Mockup design of Contact Us page.">
        <figcaption>Figure 5.8: Mockup of the Contact Us page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The contact page contains the contact info of the band, including their e-mail and social media links as well as information about where the band is based and what they are available for. This page will make the band easily available for venues and sponsors that could be interested in knowing more and possibly booking the band, or would want to make a sponsor deal. This is also a page which lets fans and other visitors know where they can find out more about Excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page features the same design as the other subpages, with a picture header above the title, and the style of the text and colors matching the rest of the site. Beneath the title ‘Contact Us’ there is the e-mail address, then other info, and finally an encouragement to visit Excellence social media sites along with two buttons linking to their Facebook page and YouTube channels. The social media buttons are of size 70x70px.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Contact Us page contributes to making the band more international by allowing venues from all over the world to contact the band, and also advertises their social media channels to contribute to the like and subscribers goal.
      </p>

      <h3>5.9 Guestbook</h3>

    <h2>6. Minimum Requirements for JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      An implementation of a guestbook, utilizing JavaScript to handle button clicks and the contents of text boxes. As an extended goal, it may use an in-browser database to locally store comments submitted by the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discography page will generate album elements from JavaScript to keep the HTML document DRY. It will pull information on the album art, titles and songs which will be available on the JavaScript side. DOM elements will be inserted into the viewable document.
    </p>
    <p>
      The navigation bar will switch pages by issuing XMLHttpRequests and swapping the current page’s content with the next page. In addition to this, given enough time, transitions may be applied to make it look more aesthetically pleasing (as the page will otherwise blink over to the other page upon swapping).
    </p>
    <p>
      On homepage, the concert image will fade in from being invisible, giving the user a soft introduction to the image. This can be done using a mix of CSS and JavaScript, where the image starts with 0 opacity, and upon page load the JavaScript will add a CSS class which triggers a transition to full opacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>(Outside minimum requirements)</i>
      In the navigation bar, dropdown menus will be used to hide most links to the subpages. The dropdown menus will be revealed upon clicking the menu items. An extended goal will be to apply an expanding animation to make it more visually pleasing.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline the tasks
      to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible for them. Include a
      list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include a
      complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and
      when you expect to get them. To the greatest extent you can, try to have all of these things by
      the time your design is done, so that nothing will delay your coding.
